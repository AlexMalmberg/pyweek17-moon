pyweek17-moon
=============

The full moon has transformed you into a hungry werewolf. Now you must
find something to eat and get back to your house before dawn, all
while avoiding discovery by the other villagers who ceaselessly watch
over the village from their houses.

To run:
  python run_game.py --fullscreen

(or drop the --fullscreen if you want it windowed, or change the size
of the window with --window 123x456)

More half-baked than usual, but:
  Move with arrow keys.
  Visit the blue flashing targets in order.
  Stick to the shadow to avoid discovery.
  Try to beat the par times for each level!
